# Server Administration Essential Training

### Server Architecture
**Form factor**. This refers to the size, shape, and overall packaging of the computer device.
1. **Tower Server.** This server is similar to desktop computers.
2. **Rack Mount Server.** It is designed to save space; servers that slide in and out of a rack.
3. **Blade Technology.** This is designed for largest number of servers in a smallest area. Unlike a rack server that is independent to other servers, blade technology works as one; server in a single card.

#### Server Components
1. Motherboard. It is the main circuit board that provides communication to all other components.
2. CPU (Processor). Differs in socket type, like AM4 or Intel Socket type.
3. RAM (Memory). ECC or non-ECC: error correction code; DDR versions like DDR4, DDR3, DDR5. 
4. Expansion Slots. These are PCI, PCI Express, AGP, etc.
5. Hard Drives and Solid State Drives.

**Hot Swappable**: This is a component that can be changed without shutting down the server.
